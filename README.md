## Data Collection
The project begins with collecting data from various CSV files, merging them based on common identifiers, and creating a comprehensive dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
Cleaning and feature engineering are performed on the dataset, including handling missing values, updating team names, and calculating driver ages.

## EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis is conducted to visualize and understand the distribution of various factors such as driver nationality, age, wins, constructor wins, and DNFs.

## Further Data Preprocessing
The dataset is prepared for classification models, including one-hot encoding categorical features and scaling numerical features.

## Model Building and Evaluation
Several machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression, are implemented and evaluated based on training and testing accuracies.

## Conclusion
The project provides insights into the relationships between different variables and aims to predict race outcomes using machine learning models.
